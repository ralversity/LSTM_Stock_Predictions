# LSTM_Stock_Predictions
This program is a Jupyter Notebook script that takes a user input for a stock symbol
(ex: AAPL - Apple, TSLA - Tesla) and generates an LSTM Neural Network prediction based on
the close prices in the last 5 years. It also generates its predicted price for the day after
the program is run.

# Installation and run guide
## Prerequisites
	Install the latest version of Anaconda
	Python 3.10 with the following libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Pandas_datareader, 
  	Sklearn, Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib, and default Python libraries.
	
## Steps to run
    1. Install the prerequisite Applications and Libraries
        a. To install libraries open cmd and type: pip install library_name
            i. Examples
                1. pip install numpy
                2. pip install pandas
                3. etc.â€¦
    2. Extract stock_predictor.rar into directory application will run from
    3. Open cmd and type: conda activate
    4. Now type: jupyter notebook
    5. Navigate file system in jupyter notebook that should open in a browser 
    to the directory you extracted the zip to and go into stock_predictor folder
    6. Click on dashboard.ipynb to open the file
    7. Run the code cell to run the application
